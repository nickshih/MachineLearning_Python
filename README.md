# DataScience&MachineLearning_Python
IBM Data Science & Machine Learning with Python Courses.
These are the IBM's machine learning and data science courses' final projects:  
  1. In the "machine learning for Python" project, I built K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression models to predict loan's default.
  2. In the "analysis of US Economic Data" project, a dashboard is created for gdp versus unemployment data
